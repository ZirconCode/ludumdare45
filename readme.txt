Instructions

Tools (select by clicking the respective button, uses are limited):
Holes: Click to create a clean hole in the stone
Chisel: Hold to slowly produce randomized cracks, if there are holes within the displayed radius, cracks will definitely jump rapidly to these holes.
Remove Part: Removes a connected component from the block of stone.

NOTE: Removing parts may take a bit, patience =)
