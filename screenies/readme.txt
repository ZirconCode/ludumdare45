Note:


THEME: Start with Nothing


I have to sleep right after theme announcement.
Then I will have a little time on saturday to teach myself godot.

Then sunday I will make the game.


Enjoy!



------------------


Update:


Helped a friend move, have an idea of sculpting a goal statue from nothing with some more or less stochastic tools.

Will now spend saturday evening learning godot and hopefully making a prototype.


------------------

DINNER


------------------


PROTOTYPE TIME!!!


-----------


SLEEP TIME

still not sure how to fix the "floodfill" breaking away pieces issue.
godot seems surprsingly unflexible if not want completely predictable things. =/



-----------


SUNDAY:

Friend made some great music.
Am at other friends place, maybe we can find a good solution to the flood fill godot clash.



Almost minimal prototype! Woooooo!!!
